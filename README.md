# Overview

This program displays a simple message to the screen. Being able to run this program proved that I set up my integrated development environment, downloaded Python, and a compiler to work with Python correctly. I also learned some basic Python syntax such as print and how to type out a string statement.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
